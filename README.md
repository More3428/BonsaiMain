# BonsaiMain
Bonsai Maintenance app made using C++
Allows users to add bonsias, view bonsais and related info like last date watered and pruned and dates
uses a File/IO system for saving data. 
Will use Json to be able to print out the files in a viewable format. 

Future(want to add an embedded feature that outputs moist levels of each tree in real time. Using an arduino)
