# BonsaiMain
Bonsai Maintenance app made using C++
Allows users to add bonsias, view bonsais and related info like last date watered and pruned and dates
uses a File/IO system for saving data. 
Will use Json to be able to print out the files in a viewable format. 
Key features include:

Viewing all bonsai trees with detailed information

Adding new bonsai records through guided prompts

Editing and updating existing tree information

Deleting bonsai entries from the collection

Robust user input validation and clear feedback

Persistent storage using plain-text files for reliable record-keeping

Skills demonstrated:
C++ (structs, vectors, file handling, modular code), input validation, CLI design, and basic data persistence.
Future(want to add an embedded feature that outputs moist levels of each tree in real time. Using an arduino)
